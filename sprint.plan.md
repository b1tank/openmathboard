# Sprint — Shape Palette UX & Cleanup

## Goal
Improve shape palette interaction (drag-only creates), cleanup parabola auto-detect, add horizontal/vertical lines, fix axes width.

## Tasks

- [x] **T1 — Drag-to-create shapes only (no click-create)**
  Clicking a shape in the palette should only focus/highlight it, not create it on canvas. Only dragging from palette onto the canvas creates the shape.

- [x] **T2 — 2D axes medium width**
  Change axes default width from 2 to 4 (matching other shapes like line, parabola, etc.).

- [x] **T3 — Remove parabola auto-detect from conversion popup**
  Remove parabola detection from the freehand conversion popup entirely. The built-in parabola shape in the palette is sufficient.

- [x] **T4 — Add horizontal and vertical straight line shapes**
  Add perfectly horizontal and vertical line shapes to the palette as separate entries.

- [x] **T5 — Build check & push**

## Hiccups & Notes

- No blockers encountered. All tasks completed cleanly.
